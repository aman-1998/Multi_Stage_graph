# Multi-Stage graph (Shortest Path):

A Multistage graph is a directed graph in which the nodes can be divided into a set of stages
such that all edges are from a stage to next stage only (In other words there is no edge 
between vertices of same stage and from a vertex of current stage to previous stage).

We are give a multistage graph, a source and a destination, we need to find shortest path 
from source to destination. By convention, we consider source at stage 1 and destination as last
stage.
